#The Fantasia Store

##About the Project and The Motivation Behind It

This is project 2 based in back-end development. This interacts with the database No-SQL database such as MongoDB.
 As such we are dealing with entry and retrieval of information from databases and routes.

The story behind the creation of this project is that I am much of a fantasy fanatic such as my last project was based on fantasy as well. 
 As such in this manner there will now there be a creation of a store. As such there should always there be 3 things a store should have as such 
 weapons in a fantasy setting, armor to protect yourself, and utilities for any situation, expected or unexpected.

#How to Use
To First Access any of the first pages it would be localhost:3000/
Then which every database which you want to access, such as (Armor, Miscellaneous, or Weapons) just add it exactly after the `localhost:3000/` after installing the program from Github
Then from there everything should be easy as a click of a button.

#Improvements
Where it all could be redirected to a page and as such create a database where it could sort which bit of data would be in which sections. As such three important areas would be:
-Ease of use to get to the databases
-Organization of data
-More development as a store
